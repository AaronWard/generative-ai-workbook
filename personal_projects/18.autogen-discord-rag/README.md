## Autogen Discord RAG


I want to develop a LLM Application that will let me ask any question with regards to Autogen. The application should be able to:
1. Search discord history for answers
2. Multi model capabilities to retrieve images also.
3. Search the internet to get additional information if needed.

To pull message history, I am using an extension called [Discrub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/discrub/plhdclenpaecffbcefjmpkkbdpkmhhbj/related) as i had issues setting up the Discord API. Data pull is up until `15th November 2023`.
