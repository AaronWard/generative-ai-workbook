- tree(directory, prefix, depth_remaining): Prints a directory tree. Use to visualize directory structures.
- find_function_signatures(file_path, language): Finds function signatures in a file. Use for code analysis.
- extract_function(file_path, signature, language): Extracts the code of a function using its signature. Use to work on specific functions.
