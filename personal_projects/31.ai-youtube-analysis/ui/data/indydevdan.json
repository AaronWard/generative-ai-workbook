        "summary": "In this video, the presenter discusses the use of prompt chains in AI and why startups are moving away from using complex LLM libraries like Langchain and Autogen. The focus is on using a minimalist prompt chaining method that enhances productivity without relying on libraries or wrappers. The video explains how to build effective prompt chains using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, highlighting the importance of staying close to the metal by controlling prompts directly.\n\nThe presenter introduces a minimalist chainable API that allows for creating sequential prompt chains with context and output back references. This method is demonstrated through an example of generating a blog post with a title, hook, and first paragraph using chained prompts. The key benefits of using prompt chains include handling complex tasks, increasing prompt performance, reducing errors, and allowing the use of previous prompt outputs as inputs for subsequent prompts.\n\nFour guiding questions are proposed to determine when to use prompt chains: if tasks are too complex for a single prompt, if maximum error reduction is needed, if subsequent prompts require previous outputs, and if adaptive workflow control is necessary.\n\nThe video also discusses the problems with LLM libraries, such as unnecessary abstractions, difficulty in finishing projects, and inadequate documentation. The presenter advocates for a lean approach\u2014staying close to the metal by focusing on the prompt itself rather than relying on library abstractions.\n\nThe video concludes with a demonstration of a production-level agentic workflow using prompt chains, showing how this approach can be applied to real-world applications. The emphasis is on maintaining control over AI workflows and adapting quickly to new models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet without over-relying on external libraries.",

        "description": "What comes next after AI Agents? What's the most useful workflow for your agents?\n\nThe answer is pretty clear, the best way to use your growing collection of AI Agents is in the form of a personal AI assistant.\n\nNot just 'a' personal AI assistant, YOUR personal AI assistant.\n\nImagine a tool so powerful, it feels like an extension of your mind. In this video, we dive into the creation of the most important agentic application we can build and use: Your Personal AI assistant. This tool will be limited only by your imagination, and your ability to hop in your python or typescript code and COOK up great agentic workflows, AI Agents, prompt chains, and individual prompts. Your personal assistant can code for you, research for you, and organizing your digital life. BUT in order to get to that vision we have to take small, incremental steps. Here we look an EARLY prototype of what future personal AI assistants (the next level of VAs) will look like through ADA. ADA is the name of my, personal AI assistant. It's a prototype to show what this technology will be able to do for you.\n\nIn order to make use of your AI Agents and prompt chains in the form of your personal AI assistant, we need a framework for prompting your agents. In this video we introduce two critical frameworks for building your personal AI assistant: the PAR framework, and the simple keyword AI Agent Router (LLM Router). The PAR framework sets an a clean loop for you and your personal AI assistant. First you speak in natural language, we run text-to-speech (TTS) to capture your prompt and convert it into text which becomes your nlp/prompt (natural language prompt). \n\nNext we use an LLM Router called the simple keyword AI Agent Router which takes your prompt and decides which AI Agents to run. Your agents run their individual, isolated workflows, and finally  your personal ai assistant (ai va) responds to you using speech-to-text (STT) completed the PAR framework.\n\nThe beauty of this framework is that it doesn't make any assumptions about your prompts, prompt chains, or agents, all of that runs from the llm router based on your activation keywords based on your prompt. You can run langchain, crewai, autogen, or any other agent framework to build and run your agentic workflows. In future videos we'll be utilizing the AgentOS micro architecture to build reusable, composable AI Agents. Our LLM Router will then route to our individual agents to run dedicated functionality.\n\nThis is just the beginning of the most important agentic application we can build and use: Your Personal AI assistant.\n\nStay focused, and keep building.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Personal AI Assistant Gist (Draft/Read Only)\nhttps://gist.github.com/disler/2840f0404c44fc662f7673d783b89f81\n\n\ud83e\udd16 AgentOS - Build reusable, composable agents\nhttps://youtu.be/8wSH4XukcH8\n\n\ud83d\udd0d 7 Prompt Chains For Better AI Agents\nhttps://youtu.be/QV6kaNFyoyQ\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Chapters\n00:00 The Agentic Pieces are LINING up\n00:33 Your Personal AI Assistant\n00:55 ADA Demo, Proof of Concept\n03:05 Big Ideas, PAR Framework, LLM Router, Flaws\n03:50 Prompt, Agent, Response\n06:25 AI Agent LLM Router\n11:50 Future of Personal AI Assistants\n13:15 Everything we do is STACKING up\n14:07 Improvements, Flaws, vNext\n17:05 More AI Agents, More Prompt Chains\n\n#aiassistant #aiagents #virtualassistant",

        "description": "Agent OS is an architecture for building AI agents that focuses on IMMEDIATE results for today and over the long term.\n\nThe LLM Ecosystem is ever evolving so in order to keep up, you'll need an architecture that has interchangeable parts that can be swapped in and out as needed. This is where the Agent OS comes in.\n\nA great architecture, can future proof your AI agents and make them more adaptable.\n\nThe Agent OS is a micro architecture based off of Andrej Kaparthy's LLM OS. It's comprises three primary components: the Language Processing Unit (LPU), Input/Output (IO), and Random Access Memory (RAM). Each serves a unique purpose in the construction of AI agents, enabling you, the developer, to create systems that are not only efficient but also adaptable to the rapidly changing landscape of AI/LLM technology. The LPU, positioned at the core of the architecture, integrates model providers, individual models, prompts, and prompt chains into a cohesive unit. By storing all llm, and prompt related functionality into one component, the LPU, we can focus on prompt engineering and prompt testing around this unit of this Agent. This integration facilitates the creation of AI agents capable of solving specific problems with high precision. Thanks to the layered architecture, each piece can be swapped out. So when GPT-4.5 or GPT-5 rolls out, you can easily upgrade your AI agent without having to rebuild the entire system from scratch. \n\nThe RAM component enables your AI agent to operate on state, allowing it to adapt to changing inputs and produce novel results. The IO layer, on the other hand, provides the tools (function calling) necessary for your AI agent to interact with the real world. This includes making web requests, interacting with databases, and monitoring the agent's performance through spyware. By monitoring your AI agent's state, inputs, and outputs, you can identify issues and make improvements to the system.\n\nIn this video we dig into ideas of creating composable agents where the input of one agent can be the output of another agent. This is a powerful concept that can be used to create complex agents that can solve a wide range of problems. It's the evolution of the core idea agentic engineering is built on: The prompt is the new fundamental unit of programming and knowledge work. First you have llms, then prompts, then prompt chains, then AI Agents, and then Agentic Workflows. This is the future of programming and knowledge work.\n\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Andrej Karpathy\u2019s LLM OS\nhttps://youtu.be/zjkBMFhNj_g?si=lY10VSHBUGDPA8Hs\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17 7 Prompt Chains for Powerful AI Agents\nhttps://youtu.be/QV6kaNFyoyQ\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbb  Everything is a Function\nhttps://youtu.be/q3Ld-MxlXmA\n\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Multi Agent Spyware\nhttps://youtu.be/UA6IVMDPuC8\n\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Chapters\n00:00 Best way to build AI Agents?\n00:39 Agent OS\n01:58 Big Ideas (Summary) \n02:48 Breakdown Agent OS: LPU, RAM, I/O\n04:03 Language Processing Unit (LPU) \n05:42 Is this over engineering?\n07:30 Memory, Context, State (RAM)\n08:20 Tools, Function Calling, Spyware (I/O) \n10:22 How do you know your Architecture is good? \n13:27 Agent Composability \n16:40 What's missing from Agent OS? \n18:53 The Prompt is the...\n\n\n#aiagent #llm #architecture",
