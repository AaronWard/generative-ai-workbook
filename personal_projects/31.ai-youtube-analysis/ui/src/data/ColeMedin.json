        "description": "There isn't even a competition right now - Windsurf is hands down the best AI IDE. It combines the best of both worlds - it's super easy to collaborate with it as a Copilot, but it's also able to handle long running and complex coding tasks itself as an Agent.\n\nAnd because of that... I'm addicted. And in this video I'll show you how I've learned to use it to get INSANE results.\n\nIt's certainly not perfect - I still prefer oTToDev/Bolt.new for creating my initial frontends (great synergy there btw), and you still have to have a lot of technical knowledge to truly build something \"production ready\". But it's already saved me HOURS and HOURS of coding, which gives me the time to build on top of what it creates to make my projects super high quality!\n\nHow do I go about doing that? Well in this video I cover some tips and tricks that have helped me get the most out of Windsurf! These are pretty specific because the platform is very intuitive overall, but I hope that these can help you truly get the most out of this incredible technology!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:49 - What Makes Windsurf so Incredible\n04:34 - My Flow - oTToDev/Bolt + Windsurf\n05:47 - SEOWriting\n07:49 - Making You a Windsurf Superuser\n08:27 - Tip 1 - Restart Conversations\n09:16 - Tip 2 - Break Prompt into Smaller Requests\n10:12 - Tip 3 - Test Before You Reject\n11:10 - Tip 4 - Reject/Accept Specific Changes\n12:08 - Tip 5 - @ mention files/functions\n13:06 - Tip 6 - Describe Your Tech Stack\n14:20 - Tip 7 - Sometimes o1 Saves the Day\n15:14 - Tip 8 - Making Directed Changes to Code\n16:21 - Tip 9 - Document Your Code the Right Way\n17:51 - Tip 10 - Write Your Tests with Windsurf\n18:42 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSign up for SEOWriting with the link below and use the code COLE25 for a 25% discount!\n\nhttps://seowriting.ai/\n\nJoin the Discourse community for oTToDev, our fork of Bolt.new:\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai\n\nI'm building something BIG behind the scenes for you:\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai\n\nWindsurf:\n\nhttps://codeium.com/windsurf\n\nThe initial prompt I used to create the app I show in the video:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yfzn3NqKSdBKiDYKPmSy2n-FvzvW5s06iO1dFon5Q0s/edit?usp=sharing\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world.

        "description": "The future of AI coding assistants is building in a sort of RAG so the LLMs have real time knowledge of up to date documentation as they create code. In this video, I show you one way you can start doing that NOW with the Claude computer use API! Computer use is in beta as stated officially by Anthropic, so this entire setup is experimental, but it's insanely cool to see the direction we are headed with all of this.\n\nAI coding assistants, whether in the browser like Bolt.new and oTToDev, or IDEs like Windsurf and Cursor, are all AMAZING and save you hours and hours building a prototype for literally any app you can dream of. However, one huge flaw with these platforms is none of them have external knowledge for crucial things like library documentation.\n\nFor example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (and any LLM really) doesn't know the latest changes made to the LangChain framework, or how to work with the latest version of Next.js. It would require somehow giving parts of their documentation to the LLM for it to generate working code.\n\nThat is why some form of RAG (retrieval augmented generation) is needed for these models, otherwise we'll always be stuck in 2023, or whatever the training cutoff is for the model, creating our apps! Plus just because documentation existed before the training cutoff for the LLM doesn't mean it knows it. That's usually just for the larger libraries/frameworks.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Video Teaser\n00:14 - The Problem with AI Coding Assistants\n00:52 - Watch Bolt Fail to Build a Simple App\n03:40 - The Solution - Claude Computer Use API\n05:32 - Demoing Bolt.new + Claude Computer Use\n09:28 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin the Discourse community for oTToDev, our fork of Bolt.new:\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai\n\nI'm building something BIG behind the scenes for you:\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai\n\nAnthropic article for Claude Computer Use:\n\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/news/developing-computer-use\n\nGitHub repo to try Claude Computer Use:\n\nhttps://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo\n\nBolt.new:\n\nhttps://bolt.new/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world.

Simply put, it has to be made available over the internet for other people to access in a secure way.\n\nSo in this video, I walk you through step by step how to deploy your AI apps to the cloud, using the local AI starter kit by n8n as the example! But this guide will work for really ANY AI app - built with Streamlit, OpenWebUI, Next.js, Docker apps, etc.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Plan of Attack\n01:39 - What I'm Deploying as an Example\n02:52 - Cloud Machine Setup w/ DigitalOcean\n05:59 - Steps 1-2 - Clone repo and cd into it\n06:10 - Steps 3-4 - Edit the .env and docker-compose.yml files\n08:08 - Steps 5-7 - Firewall Setup\n09:08 - Steps 8-13 - Reverse Proxy Setup with Nginx\n12:51 - Step 14 - DNS Record Setup\n14:06 - Steps 15-16 - SSL Certificate Installation\n15:02 - Step 17 - Spin up the Containers!\n16:57 - Testing our AI App Deployment\n20:49 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBelow are the EXACT steps I cover in the video. This will work on any cloud provider as long as you have a Ubuntu Linux machine. If you don't, some of the steps might have to be a bit different but the process will be very similar. \n\nMost of the steps will be the same regardless of what you are deploying! Steps 1-4 and 17 are specifically for the local AI starter kit, the rest are very app agnostic.\n\nPrerequisite: You have a machine in the cloud with Docker installed.\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git\n\n2. cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit\n\n3. Edit the .env file to edit POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB, N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY, and N8N_USER_MANAGEMENT_JWT_SECRET\n\nYou can edit the .env by entering the command \"nano .env\", adding in the contents, and then saving with \"Ctrl/Cmd + X, then enter Y, then hit enter\".\n\n4. Edit the docker-compose.yml file to set the Ollama command on line 44 to:\n\n\"sleep 3; OLLAMA_HOST=ollama:11434 ollama pull llama3.1; OLLAMA_HOST=ollama:11434 ollama pull nomic-embed-text\"\n\n5. sudo ufw enable\n\n6. sudo ufw allow 80 && sudo ufw allow 443\n\n7. sudo ufw reload\n\n8. sudo apt install nginx\n\n9. sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/local-ai-app\n\n10.
