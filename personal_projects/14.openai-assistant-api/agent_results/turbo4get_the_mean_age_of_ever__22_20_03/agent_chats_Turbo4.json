While the `age_at_diagnosis` is also available, the requirement seems to suggest using the `current_age` as the relevant field for the mean.\n\nHere's the SQL query to do that:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(current_age) AS mean_age\nFROM patients\nWHERE diagnosed_covid = true;\n```\n\nThis query calculates the average (mean) of the `current_age` column, only including rows where `diagnosed_covid` is set to `true`, which indicates those who have been diagnosed with COVID. The result is aliased as `mean_age`.",
