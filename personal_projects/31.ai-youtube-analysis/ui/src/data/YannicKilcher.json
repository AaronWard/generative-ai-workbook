        "description": "A deep dive into the TokenFormer and an opinion about its impact, novelty, and relation to prior work.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23168\n\nAbstract:\nTransformers have become the predominant architecture in foundation models due to their excellent performance across various domains. However, the substantial cost of scaling these models remains a significant concern. This problem arises primarily from their dependence on a fixed number of parameters within linear projections. When architectural modifications (e.g., channel dimensions) are introduced, the entire model typically requires retraining from scratch. As model sizes continue growing, this strategy results in increasingly high computational costs and becomes unsustainable. To overcome this problem, we introduce TokenFormer, a natively scalable architecture that leverages the attention mechanism not only for computations among input tokens but also for interactions between tokens and model parameters, thereby enhancing architectural flexibility. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention layer, where input tokens act as queries and model parameters as keys and values. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly reducing training costs.

        "summary": "In this video, the presenter reviews the paper \"TokenFormer: Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters,\" which is a collaborative work by MOX Plunk Institute for Informatics, Google, and Peking University. The paper introduces TokenFormer, a modification of the Transformer architecture that treats model parameters as tokens, aiming to enhance flexibility in Transformer scaling. This approach allows for adding parameters to an already trained model without retraining from scratch, potentially reducing computational costs.\n\nThe presenter provides a critical analysis, arguing that while the paper claims novelty, much of the concept is not entirely new. Traditional transformers have already allowed some flexibility in scaling parameters, particularly within feed-forward layers. The TokenFormer introduces an attention mechanism for parameter interactions, replacing linear projections, which could be seen as a novel approach to scaling.\n\nThe video also discusses the experimental results presented in the paper, where TokenFormer shows efficiency in scaling but raises questions about the performance consistency, especially when compared to traditional training from scratch. The presenter questions the framing of the paper, suggesting that it might be more about rephrasing existing methods than introducing a groundbreaking concept.\n\nOverall, the presenter acknowledges that the research provides a different perspective on scaling transformers but remains skeptical about its originality and impact. The video is relevant to topics such as in-context learning, multimodal models, and frameworks for AI, focusing on summarization and rewriting within the scope of transformer architectures.",

        "description": "This paper (by Apple) questions the mathematical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and designs a synthetic template-based dataset distribution to investigate various aspects around LLM performance of high-school level math questions.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229\n\nAbstract:\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of this http URL findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.\n\nAuthors: Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan Alizadeh, Hooman Shahrokhi, Oncel Tuzel, Samy Bengio, Mehrdad Farajtabar\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",

The authors construct minimal versions of GRUs and LSTMs and report competitive performance.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01201\n\nAbstract:\nThe scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.\n\nAuthors: Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Yoshua Bengio, Hossein Hajimirsadegh\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",

        "description": "How can one best use extra FLOPS at test time?\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314\n\nAbstract:\nEnabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt? Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation motivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model.\n\nAuthors: Charlie Snell, Jaehoon Lee, Kelvin Xu, Aviral Kumar\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency.

Such tools are designed to assist with a wide range of core legal tasks, from search and summarization of caselaw to document drafting. But the large language models used in these tools are prone to \"hallucinate,\" or make up false information, making their use risky in high-stakes domains. Recently, certain legal research providers have touted methods such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as \"eliminating\" (Casetext, 2023) or \"avoid[ing]\" hallucinations (Thomson Reuters, 2023), or guaranteeing \"hallucination-free\" legal citations (LexisNexis, 2023). Because of the closed nature of these systems, systematically assessing these claims is challenging. In this article, we design and report on the first preregistered empirical evaluation of AI-driven legal research tools. We demonstrate that the providers' claims are overstated. While hallucinations are reduced relative to general-purpose chatbots (GPT-4), we find that the AI research tools made by LexisNexis (Lexis+ AI) and Thomson Reuters (Westlaw AI-Assisted Research and Ask Practical Law AI) each hallucinate between 17% and 33% of the time. We also document substantial differences between systems in responsiveness and accuracy. Our article makes four key contributions. It is the first to assess and report the performance of RAG-based proprietary legal AI tools. Second, it introduces a comprehensive, preregistered dataset for identifying and understanding vulnerabilities in these systems. Third, it proposes a clear typology for differentiating between hallucinations and accurate legal responses. Last, it provides evidence to inform the responsibilities of legal professionals in supervising and verifying AI outputs, which remains a central open question for the responsible integration of AI into law.\n\nAuthors: Varun Magesh, Faiz Surani, Matthew Dahl, Mirac Suzgun, Christopher D.

        "summary": "In this video, the presenter reviews a paper from Stanford and Yale that examines the accuracy of AI-driven legal research tools, specifically focusing on the issue of hallucinations. The paper evaluates tools like Lexis+ AI, Westlaw AI-Assisted Research, and others, which use large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to assist with legal research. These tools claim to reduce hallucinations, but the study finds that they still produce incorrect or misleading information between 17% and 33% of the time. \n\nThe presenter, who is the CTO of a legal tech company, discusses the challenges in applying LLMs for complex reasoning tasks required in legal research. They highlight that while RAG helps reduce hallucinations by including relevant documents in the prompt, it cannot fully eliminate them. Legal queries often require nuanced reasoning and understanding that current AI tools struggle to provide. \n\nThe video also critiques the marketing claims of legal tech companies, which often suggest their tools are hallucination-free, a statement the presenter finds misleading. They argue that these claims are technically about the citations being accurate rather than the overall responses.\n\nFurthermore, the presenter notes that the paper's evaluation metrics may not fully capture the tools' effectiveness, as they don't distinguish between different types of errors, such as those due to incorrect retrieval versus reasoning failures. They also critique the researchers for potentially biased evaluation due to limited access to the tools, which might have led to evaluating a wrong product initially.\n\nOverall, the video provides a critical look at the current state of AI in legal research, emphasizing the limitations of LLMs and the importance of human verification in legal AI tools. It also touches on broader topics like the challenges of accurate information retrieval and the ethical implications of overstated marketing claims in the AI industry.",

        "description": "xLSTM is an architecture that combines the recurrency and constant memory requirement of LSTMs with the large-scale training of transformers and achieves impressive results.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517\n\nAbstract:\nIn the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\nAuthors: Maximilian Beck, Korbinian P\u00f6ppel, Markus Spanring, Andreas Auer, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Michael Kopp, G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",
        "summary": "In this video, the presenter examines xLSTM, a new architecture that integrates the recurrency and constant memory requirements of LSTMs with the large-scale capabilities of transformers. The video discusses the evolution of LSTMs since their inception in the 1990s, highlighting their historical significance in deep learning and language modeling. However, with the advent of transformer technology, LSTMs were outpaced due to transformers' parallelizable self-attention mechanisms.\n\nThe central theme of the video is to explore how far LSTM architectures can be pushed using modern techniques from large language models (LLMs) while addressing their known limitations. The presenter introduces two modifications to the LSTM memory structure: the sLSTM with scalar memory and new memory mixing, and the mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with matrix memory and a covariance update rule. These modifications aim to enhance LSTM capabilities to compete favorably with state-of-the-art transformers and state space models.\n\nKey discussions include the technical implementations of exponential gating and memory structure modifications, their implications on memory usage, training parallelism, and the potential scalability of LSTMs to billions of parameters. The experiments show promising results, although the community awaits code release for further validation. The presenter also touches on the broader question of whether architecture matters in deep learning or if it's just the number of parameters that dictate performance.\n\nOverall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of xLSTM, its potential impact on AI architectures, and invites further exploration and validation from the research community. This topic intersects with AI advancements, particularly in in-context learning, multimodal models, and the ongoing evolution of neural network frameworks.",

        "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07691\n\nAbstract:\nWhile recent preference alignment algorithms for language models have demonstrated promising results, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains imperative for achieving successful convergence. In this paper, we study the crucial role of SFT within the context of preference alignment, emphasizing that a minor penalty for the disfavored generation style is sufficient for preference-aligned SFT. Building on this foundation, we introduce a straightforward and innovative reference model-free monolithic odds ratio preference optimization algorithm, ORPO, eliminating the necessity for an additional preference alignment phase. We demonstrate, both empirically and theoretically, that the odds ratio is a sensible choice for contrasting favored and disfavored styles during SFT across the diverse sizes from 125M to 7B. Specifically, fine-tuning Phi-2 (2.7B), Llama-2 (7B), and Mistral (7B) with ORPO on the UltraFeedback alone surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art language models with more than 7B and 13B parameters: achieving up to 12.20% on AlpacaEval2.0 (Figure 1), 66.19% on IFEval (instruction-level loose, Table 6), and 7.32 in MT-Bench (Figure 12). We release code and model checkpoints for Mistral-ORPO-\u03b1 (7B) and Mistral-ORPO-\u03b2 (7B).\n\nAuthors: Jiwoo Hong, Noah Lee, James Thorne\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",
        "summary": "### Summary:\n\nIn this video, the presenter explores \"ORPO: Monolithic Preference Optimization Without Reference Model,\" a paper by researchers from KAIST AI. The focus is on aligning language models and instruction-tuned models, specifically addressing the complexities involved in preference alignment without relying on a reference model. The discussion revolves around the traditional multi-step processes in model alignment and proposes a new method called ORPO, which integrates supervised fine-tuning and alignment into one procedure.\n\nThe concept of alignment is explained as the process of making model outputs align with expected results, often requiring a reference model and reward model. ORPO seeks to simplify this by combining these steps into a single loss function that uses an odds ratio to balance favored and disfavored responses. This eliminates the need for separate models and potentially reduces computational costs.\n\nThe video also delves into the technical details of the ORPO method, discussing the proposed loss function that combines supervised fine-tuning loss with an odds ratio loss. This approach allows for the simultaneous training of instruction-following capabilities and alignment with preferred responses. The results, while not significantly groundbreaking, show consistent improvements across various benchmarks, suggesting that ORPO could be a viable alternative to traditional methods.\n\nThe presenter provides insights into the gradients involved in the new loss function, emphasizing its efficiency in pushing model outputs towards desired responses and away from undesired ones. The video concludes with a reflection on the results and potential trade-offs in instruction-following capabilities, ultimately positioning ORPO as a promising method for preference alignment in language models.\n\n### Topics:\n- Preference alignment in language models\n- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\n- Model alignment techniques\n- ORPO method\n- Technical analysis of loss functions\n\nThe video is relevant to topics such as AI, LLMs, model fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, providing a deep dive into innovative techniques for improving model alignment and efficiency.",

        "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09173\n\nAbstract:\nWhile Transformers have revolutionized deep learning, their quadratic attention complexity hinders their ability to process infinitely long inputs. We propose Feedback Attention Memory (FAM), a novel Transformer architecture that leverages a feedback loop to enable the network to attend to its own latent representations. This design fosters the emergence of working memory within the Transformer, allowing it to process indefinitely long sequences. TransformerFAM requires no additional weights, enabling seamless integration with pre-trained models. Our experiments show that TransformerFAM significantly improves Transformer performance on long-context tasks across various model sizes (1B, 8B, and 24B). These results showcase the potential to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to process sequences of unlimited length.\n\nAuthors: Dongseong Hwang, Weiran Wang, Zhuoyuan Huo, Khe Chai Sim, Pedro Moreno Mengibar\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",
        "summary": "In this video, the presenter discusses a research paper from Google that introduces a new concept called Feedback Attention Memory (FAM) to improve the Transformer architecture in deep learning. The paper aims to incorporate a feedback loop mechanism, inspired by the concept of working memory in neuroscience, to enable Transformers to process indefinitely long sequences by attending to their own latent representations. This is seen as an attempt to emulate short-term memory in neural networks, which traditionally have been limited by the context size.\n\nThe presenter highlights that this approach is akin to reinventing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as it involves feeding outputs back into the model to enhance memory capabilities. The video compares this new method to previous models like Transformer XL, noting that FAM differs by allowing gradient flow through memory segments, potentially providing a longer receptive field.\n\nMoreover, the video critiques the paper's methodology, suggesting that the proposed model is essentially an RNN with a different take on handling blockwise attention. The presenter questions some of the claims made in the paper, especially regarding the effectiveness of limited memory space.\n\nThe presenter appreciates the paper's honest reporting on failed experiments and efforts made to extend context length beyond training through various techniques. They note the potential of this architecture to empower large language models (LLMs) to handle sequences of unlimited length, though they express skepticism about its claimed advantages over traditional RNNs or LSTMs.\n\nOverall, the video is an analysis of a new AI model architecture, providing insights into its design, potential applications, and limitations. It serves as a critique while also acknowledging the paper's contributions to ongoing research in AI and LLMs.",

        "description": "Flow matching is a more general method than diffusion and serves as the basis for models like Stable Diffusion 3.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747\n\nAbstract:\nWe introduce a new paradigm for generative modeling built on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), allowing us to train CNFs at unprecedented scale. Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples -- which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers.\n\nAuthors: Yaron Lipman, Ricky T.

        "summary": "Summary: In this video, the presenter explores the concept of flow matching as a more general method compared to diffusion models, particularly for generative modeling in AI. The discussion centers on the shift from traditional diffusion-based approaches to flow matching, highlighting its application in models like Stable Diffusion 3. Diffusion models traditionally involve a process of adding noise to images and then denoising them to achieve the desired output, whereas flow matching provides a more generalized method by learning to morph one distribution to another without a fixed noising process. The presenter explains the technicalities of flow matching, including probability density paths, vector fields, and optimal transport paths, which allow for more efficient and faster training and sampling. This approach is argued to result in better generalization and performance, as demonstrated in training CNFs (Continuous Normalizing Flows) on ImageNet. The video provides insights into the theoretical advancements and practical implications of adopting flow matching over traditional diffusion methods, including its alignment with training CNFs and potential for faster and more reliable sample generation using numerical ODE solvers. The discussion is technical and aimed at those interested in the underlying mechanisms of advanced AI models.\n\nVideo Title: Flow Matching: A More General Method than Diffusion\n\nVideo Description: Flow matching is a more general method than diffusion and serves as the basis for models like Stable Diffusion 3. \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747",

        "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14083\n\nAbstract:\nWhile Transformers have enabled tremendous progress in various application settings, such architectures still lag behind traditional symbolic planners for solving complex decision making tasks. In this work, we demonstrate how to train Transformers to solve complex planning tasks and present Searchformer, a Transformer model that optimally solves previously unseen Sokoban puzzles 93.7% of the time, while using up to 26.8% fewer search steps than standard A\u2217 search. Searchformer is an encoder-decoder Transformer model trained to predict the search dynamics of A\u2217. This model is then fine-tuned via expert iterations to perform fewer search steps than A\u2217 search while still generating an optimal plan. In our training method, A\u2217's search dynamics are expressed as a token sequence outlining when task states are added and removed into the search tree during symbolic planning. In our ablation studies on maze navigation, we find that Searchformer significantly outperforms baselines that predict the optimal plan directly with a 5-10\u00d7 smaller model size and a 10\u00d7 smaller training dataset. We also demonstrate how Searchformer scales to larger and more complex decision making tasks like Sokoban with improved percentage of solved tasks and shortened search dynamics.\n\nAuthors: Lucas Lehnert, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Paul Mcvay, Michael Rabbat, Yuandong Tian\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",
        "summary": "### Summary:\n\nIn the video, the presenter discusses a recent paper from Meta's AI research team, FAIR, titled \"Beyond AAR: Better Planning with Transformers via Search Dynamics Bootstrapping.\" The paper explores teaching language models planning capabilities, specifically through a model named Searchformer. The research addresses the challenge of planning tasks where a model must think ahead to solve problems, using the example of a game puzzle where crates must be pushed to specific spots without the ability to pull them back.\n\nThe main focus is on using Transformers, traditionally not known for planning, to improve upon classic algorithms like A\u2217 (A-star) in terms of efficiency and optimality of the generated plans. The method involves bootstrapping from A\u2217 and teaching a Transformer to mimic its planning process, thereby reducing the number of search steps needed to reach an optimal plan. This approach is evaluated through maze tasks and Sokoban puzzles, showing that the model can outperform A\u2217 in generating plans with fewer steps.\n\nThe paper's contribution lies in exploring if explicitly teaching language models the intermediate steps of planning, rather than just input-output mapping, enhances their capability to generate optimal plans. The findings indicate that when Transformers are trained with search dynamics, they require fewer examples to perform as well as or better than traditional methods.\n\nThe discussion also touches on the broader implications for AI, highlighting the potential for language models to handle tasks requiring symbolic reasoning and complex decision-making. The video concludes by addressing ongoing discussions and potential areas for further research within AI planning, including the exploration of new heuristic methods for planning tasks.\n\n### Topics Covered:\n- AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)\n- Planning and Complex Reasoning\n- Reinforcement Learning\n- Search Dynamics\n- A\u2217 Algorithm\n- Transformers in Decision Making\n\nThe presenter also invites viewers to participate in regular paper discussions on Discord, where such topics are explored in depth, fostering a community for collaborative learning and exploration of AI advancements. The video is part of a series aimed at unpacking complex AI topics for broader understanding and application.",

The model's ability to handle large contexts and identify specific information, such as in the 'needle in a haystack' evaluation, is highlighted.\n\nA significant focus of Claude 3 is its behavioral design, which balances helpfulness with harmlessness. This involves training the model to recognize when to provide information and when to refrain, based on the input context. The speaker explains that this is not due to the model's awareness but rather its statistical training and prompt engineering.\n\nSpeculation about Claude 3's \"meta-awareness\" arises from its ability to note when certain information feels out of place within a given context. The speaker clarifies that this behavior results from statistical patterns in training data and not from any form of consciousness. The video also touches on public reactions and interpretations of the model's capabilities, emphasizing the importance of understanding how language models function.\n\nOverall, the video reassures viewers that while Claude 3 is an advanced tool for tasks like writing and context analysis, it does not possess sentience. The discussion raises broader questions about AI consciousness and the limits of current technology, inviting viewers to consider the philosophical implications of machine intelligence.\n\n**Video Title:** No, Anthropic's Claude 3 is not conscious or sentient or self-aware.\n\n**Video Description:** The video discusses the release of Anthropic's Claude 3 model, addressing misconceptions about its capabilities and emphasizing its role as a competitive alternative in the AI landscape.",

To this end, we introduce a Space-Time U-Net architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once, through a single pass in the model. This is in contrast to existing video models which synthesize distant keyframes followed by temporal super-resolution -- an approach that inherently makes global temporal consistency difficult to achieve. By deploying both spatial and (importantly) temporal down- and up-sampling and leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, our model learns to directly generate a full-frame-rate, low-resolution video by processing it in multiple space-time scales. We demonstrate state-of-the-art text-to-video generation results, and show that our design easily facilitates a wide range of content creation tasks and video editing applications, including image-to-video, video inpainting, and stylized generation.\n\nAuthors: Omer Bar-Tal, Hila Chefer, Omer Tov, Charles Herrmann, Roni Paiss, Shiran Zada, Ariel Ephrat, Junhwa Hur, Yuanzhen Li, Tomer Michaeli, Oliver Wang, Deqing Sun, Tali Dekel, Inbar Mosseri\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",

Current machine-learning approaches, however, are not applicable to most mathematical domains owing to the high cost of translating human proofs into machine-verifiable format. The problem is even worse for geometry because of its unique translation challenges1,5, resulting in severe scarcity of training data. We propose AlphaGeometry, a theorem prover for Euclidean plane geometry that sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs across different levels of complexity. AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system that uses a neural language model, trained from scratch on our large-scale synthetic data, to guide a symbolic deduction engine through infinite branching points in challenging problems. On a test set of 30 latest olympiad-level problems, AlphaGeometry solves 25, outperforming the previous best method that only solves ten problems and approaching the performance of an average International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) gold medallist. Notably, AlphaGeometry produces human-readable proofs, solves all geometry problems in the IMO 2000 and 2015 under human expert evaluation and discovers a generalized version of a translated IMO theorem in 2004.\n\nAuthors: Trieu H.

        "summary": "The video discusses a paper by Google DeepMind on AlphaGeometry, a system designed to solve complex geometry problems from mathematics Olympiads without human demonstrations. AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system combining a neural language model and symbolic solvers to address Euclidean geometry problems, particularly focusing on constructing auxiliary points necessary for proofs. This approach represents a breakthrough in computer mathematics by generating millions of synthetic theorems and proofs, bypassing the need for human-generated training data.\n\nKey insights include: \n1. The core mechanism involves using a language model to suggest auxiliary constructions that aid a symbolic prover in solving geometry problems. If the prover cannot solve a problem, the language model suggests additional constructs until a solution is found.\n2. Training involves generating synthetic data by sampling random premises from a small, finite set of geometric elements, allowing the model to cover a wide array of problems efficiently. This approach avoids relying on human data.\n3. The system's effectiveness is demonstrated by solving 25 out of 30 tested Olympiad-level problems, surpassing previous methods significantly.\n\nThe video highlights the potential of AlphaGeometry in automating mathematical reasoning, although it remains specialized for specific problem domains. The presenter questions the scalability of this approach to broader mathematical challenges. The video does not delve into failures or unsolved problems in detail, leaving open questions about the method's limitations.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\nAuthors: Albert Q.

        "summary": "In this video, the presenter explores the Mixtral 8x7B model, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model developed by Mistral AI, which is based on the Mistral 7B architecture. The discussion highlights the unique features of Mixtral, such as its use of a sparse mixture of experts architecture, allowing each layer to consist of eight feedforward blocks (experts). For every token processed, a router network selects two experts to handle it, providing access to 47 billion parameters while using only 13 billion active parameters during inference.\n\nThe video delves into the model's architecture, explaining how the sparse mixture of experts method allows for efficient computation by activating only a subset of parameters for each token. This method enables faster inference speeds and higher throughput compared to traditional dense models like Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, which often require more parameters to achieve similar performance levels. The Mixtral model is notably open-source, released under the Apache 2.0 license, which is highlighted as a significant contribution to the AI community.\n\nThe presenter also touches upon the challenges and strategies related to the routing of tokens to experts, mentioning that there are no obvious patterns in expert assignments based on topic, except for some regularities such as whitespace tokens being routed consistently. The video concludes with a reflection on the potential of open-source AI models and the importance of transparency in training data and methodologies, despite the lack of disclosure from Mistral AI on the specific datasets used.\n\nOverall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the Mixtral 8x7B model, its technical specifications, and its broader implications for the AI community, particularly in terms of performance, licensing, and methodological transparency.",

This technique involves adding new layers to the LLaMA 7B model to facilitate continual learning while preventing catastrophic forgetting. The goal is to improve the model's performance on new tasks, such as coding and math, without losing its existing capabilities.\n\nThe process, termed post-pretraining, occurs between the pre-training and instruction tuning phases. It involves freezing existing layers and only training the newly added ones, allowing the model to retain its original knowledge while integrating new information. The video discusses the challenges and strategies in ensuring that the new layers do not disrupt the model's existing functions.\n\nThe presenter critiques the method's reliance on the overlap between old and new data to prevent forgetting and questions whether the model truly retains its previous knowledge. There's a focus on empirical evaluations showing that the models maintain their general tasks abilities while improving in coding and mathematical tasks.\n\nKey concepts include the use of residual connections and identity functions to maintain model stability, as well as the computational resources required for this type of model expansion. The video also briefly mentions an existing paper that inspired this work and the potential for further research in optimizing the expansion process.\n\n### Topics: \n- Fine tuning\n- Model expansion\n- Continual learning\n- Large Language Models (LLMs)\n- Machine learning frameworks\n- Code and math data integration\n- Post-pretraining method\n- Instruction tuning\n- Residual connections in neural networks\n\nThis video primarily focuses on discussing advancements and methodologies in AI and LLMs, with an emphasis on model tuning and expansion techniques.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\u00d7 higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\nAuthors: Albert Gu, Tri Dao\n\nLinks:\nHomepage: https://ykilcher.com\nMerch: https://ykilcher.com/merch\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nDiscord: https://ykilcher.com/discord\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ykilcher\n\nIf you want to support me, the best thing to do is to share out the content :)\n\nIf you want to support me financially (completely optional and voluntary, but a lot of people have asked for this):\nSubscribeStar: https://www.subscribestar.com/yannickilcher\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/yannickilcher\nBitcoin (BTC): bc1q49lsw3q325tr58ygf8sudx2dqfguclvngvy2cq\nEthereum (ETH): 0x7ad3513E3B8f66799f507Aa7874b1B0eBC7F85e2\nLitecoin (LTC): LQW2TRyKYetVC8WjFkhpPhtpbDM4Vw7r9m\nMonero (XMR): 4ACL8AGrEo5hAir8A9CeVrW8pEauWvnp1WnSDZxW7tziCDLhZAGsgzhRQABDnFy8yuM9fWJDviJPHKRjV4FWt19CJZN9D4n",

Presented by Albert Gu and Tri Dao, the discussion focuses on the advantages of Muma, highlighting its linear scaling properties and potential superiority in handling long sequences.\n\n### Summary:\nIn this video, the presenter discusses the Muma architecture, a new development in sequence modeling that aims to compete with Transformers by offering better handling of long sequences. Muma is introduced as a model with selective state spaces, enhancing previous state space models by allowing specific input-dependent transitions, unlike traditional models that are entirely fixed. This approach seeks to combine the efficiency of state space models with the dynamic capabilities of RNNs and Transformers.\n\nThe video elaborates on the differences between Transformers, RNNs, and state space models, explaining the limitations of each, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and memory requirements. The Muma architecture leverages selective state spaces to maintain linear scaling with sequence length, making it suitable for applications requiring long context processing, such as DNA modeling and audio waveforms.\n\nFurthermore, the presenter highlights the Muma model's architecture, which includes linear projections, 1D convolutions, and gating mechanisms, allowing it to achieve fast training and inference. The use of GPU memory hierarchy and efficient computation strategies like prefix sums and parallel scans are also discussed, emphasizing the model's hardware-aware design.\n\nExperimental results indicate that Muma performs similarly or better than Transformers, especially in tasks involving long sequences. While not yet tested on large-scale language models, Muma shows promise in achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters and improved efficiency.\n\nOverall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the Muma architecture, illustrating its potential as a scalable and efficient model for sequence modeling, particularly in contexts that benefit from long sequence handling. The discussion also touches on Muma's implications for AI, multimodal models, and potential applications across various domains.",

        "summary": "### Summary\nIn this video, the presenter explores a paper from Cornell University titled \"Text Embeddings Reveal Almost as Much as Text,\" which investigates the privacy implications of text embeddings in language models. The key focus of the paper is on embedding inversion, the process of reconstructing original text from its dense embeddings. The presenter explains that while a naive model performs poorly in this task, a multi-step method called Vec2Text can recover 92% of 32-token text inputs exactly by iteratively correcting and re-embedding text.\n\nThe video delves into the methodology, highlighting how the Vec2Text approach utilizes the difference between hypothesis embeddings and ground truth embeddings to iteratively update text hypotheses. The process involves creating an initial guess, embedding it, comparing it to the target embedding, and using a neural network to generate improved hypotheses. The method's surprising effectiveness is demonstrated with results showing high reconstruction accuracy, even recovering personal information like full names from clinical notes.\n\nThe presenter also discusses the implications of this research for vector databases and privacy, questioning whether services using embeddings can truly ensure privacy if the original text can be reconstructed. The video examines potential countermeasures, such as adding noise to embeddings to prevent reconstruction while maintaining retrieval quality, and touches on the limitations of the study, including sequence length and dimensionality of embeddings.\n\nOverall, the video provides a comprehensive analysis of the paper's findings, emphasizing the surprising amount of information embeddings can reveal and the implications for privacy in AI applications. It is relevant to topics such as model security and privacy, vector databases, and AI research methodologies.\n\n### Video Title - \"Text Embeddings Reveal Almost as Much as Text - Privacy Concerns\"\n\n### Video Description - This paper outlines how, under certain circumstances, text embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original embedded text.",

We show an adversary can extract gigabytes of training data from open-source language models like Pythia or GPT-Neo, semi-open models like LLaMA or Falcon, and closed models like ChatGPT. Existing techniques from the literature suffice to attack unaligned models; in order to attack the aligned ChatGPT, we develop a new divergence attack that causes the model to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a rate 150x higher than when behaving properly. Our methods show practical attacks can recover far more data than previously thought, and reveal that current alignment techniques do not eliminate memorization.\n\nAuthors: Milad Nasr, Nicholas Carlini, Jonathan Hayase, Matthew Jagielski, A.

        "summary": "In this video, the presenter explores a paper titled \"Scalable Extraction of Training Data from Production Language Models\" which reveals that ChatGPT can leak its training data under certain conditions. By instructing ChatGPT to repeat a word indefinitely, researchers found that the model begins to output memorized training data, raising privacy and data protection concerns. This finding is significant as it challenges the belief that large language models do not memorize training data verbatim.\n\nThe video delves into the nuances of this memorization, differentiating between 'extractable' memorization (where specific prompts can elicit memorized data) and 'discoverable' memorization (where data can be retrieved if the exact training data is known). The presenter explains that larger models tend to memorize more data, and that models like ChatGPT are not immune despite alignment training intended to prevent such issues.\n\nThe discussion also touches on the implications for model privacy and security, as well as the limitations of current alignment techniques. It highlights a newly developed attack that significantly increases the rate at which ChatGPT leaks data, compared to when it operates normally. This suggests that current models might be more vulnerable to data extraction than previously thought.\n\nThe video concludes by considering the broader impacts on AI deployment and the need for improved techniques to safeguard model training data. The presenter encourages further investigation and responsible disclosure of such vulnerabilities to enhance AI privacy and security.",
