What are some domains that applications can range from?,"Applications can range from mathematics, coding, question answering, operations research, online decision-making, entertainment, etc."
What are the features of AutoGen that make it suitable for multi-agent conversation?,"AutoGen uses a generic design of agents that can leverage LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them. The result is that developers can easily and quickly create agents with different roles (e.g., agents to write code, execute code, wire in human feedback, validate outputs, etc.) by selecting and configuring a subset of built-in capabilities. The agent’s backend can also be readily extended to allow more custom behaviors. Additionally, every agent is made conversable to make them suitable for multi-agent conversation."
What is AutoGen used for?,AutoGen is used for programming the interaction behavior between agents via conversation-centric computation and control. It provides ready-to-use implementations and allows easy extension and experimentation for both steps.

What are the guidelines for using code to collect information and perform tasks in this AI assistant?,"When you need to collect info, you should output the info you need using code. This can include browsing or searching the web, downloading/reading a file, printing the content of a webpage or a file, or getting the current date/time. Once you have printed sufficient info and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task yourself. When you need to perform a task with code, you should use the code to perform the task and output the result. If a plan is not provided, you should explain your plan first and be clear about which steps use code and which steps use your language skill. You should indicate the script type (Python or shell) in the code block and you are not allowed to provide any other feedback or perform any other actions."
What is the equation that needs to be set up in order to find the plane that bisects the angle between the given planes and contains the given point?,"The equation that needs to be set up is Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, where A, B, C, and D are integers. A, B, C, and D need to satisfy the conditions A > 0 and gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1."
