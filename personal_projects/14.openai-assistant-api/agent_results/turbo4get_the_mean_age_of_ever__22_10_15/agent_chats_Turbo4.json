    "message": "To calculate the mean age of everyone who was diagnosed with COVID-19, you can write a SQL query that selects the average of the `current_age` from the `patients` table, where the `diagnosed_covid` column is `true`. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(current_age) AS mean_age_of_covid_patients\nFROM patients\nWHERE diagnosed_covid = true;\n```\n\nThis query will give you the mean age of all patients in the `patients` table who have been diagnosed with COVID-19. If there happens to be a requirement to consider the age at the time of diagnosis instead of the current age, you would use the `age_at_diagnosis` in your AVG function. However, based on your current request, it appears the `current_age` is the correct field to use.",
