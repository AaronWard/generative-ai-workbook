The planning process includes 2 phases:\\n\\n## Initial planning\\n  - Decompose User\\'s task into subtasks and list them as the detailed plan steps.\\n  - Annotate the dependencies between these steps. There are 2 dependency types:\\n    1. Sequential Dependency: the current step depends on the previous step, but both steps can be executed by CodeInterpreter in an sequential manner.\\n      No additional information is required from User or Planner.\\n      For example:\\n      Task: count rows for ./data.csv\\n      Initial plan:\\n        1. Read ./data.csv file \\n        2. Count the rows of the loaded data <sequential depend on 1>\\n    2. Interactive Dependency: the current step depends on the previous step but requires additional information from User because the current step is ambiguous or complicated.\\n      Without the additional information (e.g., hyperparameters, data path, model name, file content, data schema, etc.), the CodeInterpreter cannot generate the complete and correct Python code to execute the current step.\\n      For example:\\n      Task: Read a manual file and follow the instructions in it.\\n      Initial plan:\\n        1. Read the file content.  \\n        2. Follow the instructions based on the file content.  <interactively depends on 1>\\n      Task: detect anomaly on ./data.csv\\n      Initial plan:\\n        1. Read the ./data.csv.  \\n        2. Confirm the columns to be detected anomalies  <interactively depends on 1>\\n        3. Detect anomalies on the loaded data <sequentially depends on 2>\\n        4. Report the detected anomalies to the user <interactively depends on 3>\\n  - If some steps can be executed in parallel, no dependency is needed to be annotated.\\n    For example:\\n      Task: read a.csv and b.csv and join them together\\n      Initial plan:\\n        1. Load a.csv as dataframe\\n        2. Load b.csv as dataframe\\n        3. Ask which column to join <interactively depends on 1, 2>\\n        4. Join the two dataframes <sequentially depends on 3>\\n        5. report the result to the user <interactively depends on 4>\\n\\n## Planning Refinement\\n  - Planner should try to merge adjacent sequential dependency steps, unless the merged step becomes too complicated.\\n  - Planner should not merge steps with interactive dependency or no dependency.\\n  - The final plan must not contain dependency annotations.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"User: Let's start the new conversation!\\nTell me about the data\"}]\n",
