@wadymc I spent some time with function_call and I think I got some reasonable understanding.\n\nI even created an agent that can self execute its own function

user_proxy has the function_map so it knows what \"program\" to run when the assistant returns the function_call named function.\n\nAt this point I was asking myself \"why should user_proxy runs the function and not the assistant?\". At first I thought it was a bad design and I created the self execution agent. But then I found this example that made me think different\nhttps://github.com/sugarforever/LangChain-Advanced/blob/main/Integrations/AutoGen/autogen_langchain_uniswap_ai_agent.ipynb\n\nHere the assistant receives the result of the function_call from the user_proxy at each iteration and it can \"reason about this result\" so this back and forth gets richer. \n\nFor a simple use case the assistant could execute the function_call by itself and return the result, but having the user_proxy executing the code and passing the result back to assistant gives the opportunity of the assistant to \"think about the result\" because the assistant is the one with access to the LLM\n\nHope that make sense","edited_timestamp":null,"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://gist.github.com/bonadio/96435a1b6ccc32297aa8cc1db7cfc381","title":"Autogen Agent that can auto execute a function_call","description":"Autogen Agent that can auto execute a function_call -

The concept involves two group chats using AutoGen.\n\nIn the first chat, participants include the Project Manager, Architect, and Reviewer. Their primary responsibility is to understand the user's objectives, reflect on them, and then propose a solution.\n\nThe second chat comprises three coder agents, each responsible for creating different types of diagrams.\n\nWhile my code has been largely effective, there are a few issues I need help resolving. One challenge is determining how to conclude the conversation once all agents have addressed their concerns. I've attempted to expand the system_message for the user_proxy, but it hasn't been successful. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach this problem?\n\nAdditionally, I'd like one of the agents to summarize the conversation's conclusions once consensus is achieved. This summary should be packaged in a JSON format for use in the second group chat. Finally, I'd like to print \"TERMINATE\" to signal the end of the first chat and the start of the second.\n\nLast question, is there any suggestions on the optimal lenghts of the system_message for the agents?\n\nThank you to anybody who has read this, any help is appricated!","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-25T10:26:23.248000+00:00","embeds":[],"flags":0,"hit":true,"id":"1166684049629270056","mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"pinned":false,"timestamp":"2023-10-25T10:25:53.373000+00:00","tts":false,"type":0,"username":"maxgustaw"},{"attachments":[{"content_type":"image/png","filename":"token3t.PNG","height":155,"id":"1166656667123994634","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1166289755554717707/1166656667123994634/token3t.PNG?ex=6566f830&is=65548330&hm=e018cae7e68e17faca29b0785a7f19ec76e461f32640d4eb404c1a33bc3f96fd&","size":40427,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1166289755554717707/1166656667123994634/token3t.PNG?ex=6566f830&is=65548330&hm=e018cae7e68e17faca29b0785a7f19ec76e461f32640d4eb404c1a33bc3f96fd&","width":731,"local_url":null},{"content_type":"image/png","filename":"token1nt.PNG","height":156,"id":"1166656667379826749","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1166289755554717707/1166656667379826749/token1nt.PNG?ex=6566f830&is=65548330&hm=4936fd8bccbc4cc027fbeaa0ff0c50d9f813b49df5014a81d5dc90a03b020595&","size":155787,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1166289755554717707/1166656667379826749/token1nt.PNG?ex=6566f830&is=65548330&hm=4936fd8bccbc4cc027fbeaa0ff0c50d9f813b49df5014a81d5dc90a03b020595&","width":1112,"local_url":null}],"author":{"id":"204395855195668481","username":"supermalinge","global_name":"SuperMalinge","avatar":"dee9e6535c63e4aacb810eb04a653aee","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_10b9f886b513b77ccdd67c8784f1a496","sku_id":"1144059132517826601"},"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":2},"channel_id":"1166289755554717707","components":[],"content":"even with setup mistral 16k token model, the issues persists","edited_timestamp":null,"embeds":[],"flags":0,"hit":true,"id":"1166656667581165568","mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"pinned":false,"timestamp":"2023-10-25T08:37:04.984000+00:00","tts":false,"type":0,"username":"supermalinge"},{"attachments":[],"author":{"id":"1025828152183885925","username":"qingyunwu","global_name":"qingyun-wu","avatar":"a3992c5d5b4730895d99be913d54be30","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"channel_id":"1164430570189754408","components":[],"content":"Did you try the python:3 docker image?

I've created 2 agents and a user_proxy. One agent is the writer & the other is the editor. I've given them instructions to come up with an outline for a children's short story. The theme choice & chapter outline needs approval from the User_Proxy. The theme should be approved by the Admin before the writer starts creating the outline and content. However, when the chat starts the editor agent just picks a theme on it's own and starts to write an outline. I have 3 questions:\n\n1. How do I control the interaction between the agents?\n2. I'm noticing that the responses in the terminal are being truncated, however I can see the full response in the LiteLLM proxy console. I'm not sure if that's a LiteLLM configuration change or a change in the Autogen code I need to address. \n3. If I want to save the outline & content that has been generated, how do I go about doing that? I'm assuming the User_Proxy would need to be configured to save the results to a txt file? I do have docker installed via pip (along with Windows Desktop Docker), but have it set to \"False\" in the User_Proxy section of the code for now.\n\nFinally, I do have some previous DevOps experience but am mostly an AWS infrastructure/architecture guy - not a developer.

This API doesn't format the response as `openai` expects it to be. `error_data` seems to be a string while `openai` is expecting it to be an object: `{ code: \"...\" }`. Moreover I could bet that the error your API is sending is also related to the fact that it wasn't able to parse/understand `openai` lib request in the first place.\n\nIf you use VSCode, you can just follow the error file link (or just edit the file directly) and try to add a `print(error_data)` at the beginning of the `handle_error_response()` function to confirm my guess.\n\nIn any case, this surely means the API server you're using is not (perfectly?) respecting OpenAI API specs, meaning the issue is not related to Autogen (or even its `openai` dependency).","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-17T05:03:21.932000+00:00","embeds":[],"flags":4,"hit":true,"id":"1163700316894679110","mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"423249912621170688","username":"biggboii.","global_name":"matthewberman","avatar":"9ddfc85a584a524782dcce98df765b30","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0}],"pinned":false,"timestamp":"2023-10-17T04:49:36.054000+00:00","tts":false,"type":19,"username":"ivangabriele","message_reference":{"channel_id":"1162811675762753589","guild_id":"1153072414184452236","message_id":"1163666136366321714"}},{"attachments":[],"author":{"id":"777302480689954856","username":"ivangabriele","global_name":"Ivan Gabriele","avatar":"3cc2f4e47bdaf1d7b603e3c3b829724e","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"channel_id":"1162811675762753589","components":[],"content":"To give you a final confirmation, I just ran a test using my current `main` branch code, using `Open-Orca/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca`.
