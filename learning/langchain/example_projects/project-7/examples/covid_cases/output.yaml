Thought: I need to understand the data and find a way to plot the number of COVID cases over time.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].value_counts()
Observation: DIAGNOSED_COVID
0    508
1    492
Name: count, dtype: int64
Thought: I need to group the data by dates and get the cumulative sum of the COVID cases
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum()
Observation: DIAGNOSES_DATE
2020-01-04      1

Name: DIAGNOSED_COVID, Length: 417, dtype: int64
Thought: I need to plot the cumulative sum of the COVID cases over time
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum().plot()
Observation: Axes(0.125,0.11;0.775x0.77)
Thought: I now have the plot I need, and I should save it to the working directory
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum().plot().savefig('covid_cases.png')
Observation: AttributeError: 'Axes' object has no attribute 'savefig'
Thought: I should use matplotlib to save the figure
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
              df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum().plot()
              plt.savefig('covid_cases.png')
Observation: IndentationError: unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 2)
Thought: I need to save the figure after plotting it
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
              df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum().plot()
              plt.savefig('covid_cases.png')
Observation: IndentationError: unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 2)
Thought: I should not have indented the savefig command
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
              df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum().plot()
              plt.savefig('covid_cases.png')
Observation: IndentationError: unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 2)
Thought: I should move the savefig command to the same line as the plot command
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
              df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum().plot().savefig('covid_cases.png')
Observation: IndentationError: unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 2)
Thought: I should move the import command to the same line as the plot command
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum().plot().savefig('covid_cases.png')
Observation: AttributeError: 'Axes' object has no attribute 'savefig'
Thought: I should use the plt.savefig command
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; df.groupby('DIAGNOSES_DATE')['DIAGNOSED_COVID'].sum().cumsum().plot(); plt.savefig('covid_cases.png')
Observation: 
Thought: I now have the plot I need and I have saved it to the working directory
Final Answer: The final answer is that I have successfully plotted the number of COVID cases over time and saved it to the working directory.

# You can see how the agent keeps going back over it's output because the code was throwing
# an error. it finally came around it but just writing everything in one line. 

# This took a while to get working because of the following considerations:
# * I couldn't get gpt4 to work because it's not under the endpoints available for create_pandas_dataframe_agent()
# * I needed to really handhold it, like i gave it a guide on how to be an ML engineer, clear descriptions of a simple
#   problem and it took a while pushing it in the right direction. I think adding the data dictionary did the trick.
# * The model used is text-davinci-003, which isn't really that powerful compared to GPT 3.5 turbo or GPT 4. 
# * Took me a while to come up with good prompts, really the only way to get agents to work is to have insanely
#   specific prompts. I'm sure if agent is being used for specific tasks then thats where the prompting could be easier,
#   but general task prompting is hard :)
