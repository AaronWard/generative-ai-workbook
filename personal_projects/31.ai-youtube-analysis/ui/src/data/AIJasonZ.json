    "summary": "### Video Title - How to build an AI agent that can control web browser to complete tasks like research, order pizza or book flight tickets: Step by step tutorial\n\n### Video Description\nThe video is a tutorial on building an AI agent capable of controlling a web browser to perform tasks such as research, ordering pizza, or booking flight tickets. It includes a link to free HubSpot research on AI usage in sales teams for 2024.\n\n### Summary:\nIn this tutorial, Jason Zhou explains how to develop an AI agent that can autonomously operate a web browser to perform various tasks. The video begins by discussing the potential of self-operating AI systems, emphasizing their ability to handle complex tasks beyond traditional robotic process automation (RPA). Such AI agents can navigate dynamically through websites and applications, performing tasks like data scraping and customer support with minimal setup.\n\nZhou highlights the limitations of traditional RPA, which struggles with non-standardized, complex processes, and contrasts it with the capabilities of multimodal AI models like GPT-4V. These models can adapt to changes in web environments and execute tasks by making decisions independently.\n\nThe tutorial includes two main demonstrations: \n\n1. **GPT-4V Web Scraper**: Zhou shows how to build a web scraper using GPT-4V, which captures screenshots of web pages and extracts data efficiently, surpassing traditional scraping methods. This tool can access websites that typically block scraping services by using the user's browser profile.\n\n2. **Web AI Agent**: He further demonstrates creating an AI agent that navigates web pages, clicks links, and extracts information for research purposes. The agent can simulate human browsing behavior and execute tasks like finding weather forecasts or specific business information across multiple sites.\n\nThe tutorial also addresses the technical aspects of setting up these tools, including using libraries like Puppeteer for browser interactions and OpenAI for data extraction. While current limitations exist, such as form interactions and link clicking, the tutorial showcases the potential of these AI agents in various applications, reinforcing their role as digital workers for complex tasks.\n\nThis video is relevant to topics such as multimodal models, agents, and the application of AI in web navigation and automation. It provides a detailed, step-by-step guide suitable for developers interested in leveraging AI for web-based tasks.",
