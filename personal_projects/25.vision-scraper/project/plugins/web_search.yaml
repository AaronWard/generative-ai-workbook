description: >-
  Search information from web with a query using search engine. 
  When there are too many results retrieved, some filtering might be needed afterwards. 
  If you feel the original query is not good enough, try refining it and you can have multiple queries in one call.
  If browsing is enabled, the plugin will go through the urls for more information.
  Revise the query if it is too broad. If a question is answered based on the search results, 
  the answer should be strictly based on the search results and not made up. 
  Otherwise, the answer should be "I don't know".

examples: |-
  # the original query: "Dinosaurs"
  query_results = web_search(['Dinosaurs overview', 'Types of dinosaurs', 'Dinosaur extinction event'])
  query_results = web_search(["what the weather like in Seattle?"], browse=False)
  query_results = web_search(["what are the highlights of TaskWeaver?"])
