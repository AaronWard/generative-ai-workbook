President: George Washington

 Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have maturely considered   the Act passed by the two Houses, intitled, &quot;An Act for an apportionment   of Representatives among the several States according to the first enumeration,&quot;   44 and I return it to your House, wherein it originated, with the following   objections.   First: The Constitution has prescribed that Representatives shall be apportioned   among the several States, according to their respective Numbers: and there is   no one proportion or division which, applied to the respective numbers of the   States, will yield the number and allotment of Representatives proposed by the   bill.  Second. The Constitution has also provided that the number of Representatives   shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand: which restriction is, by the   context, and by fair and obvious construction, to be applied to the seperate   and respective numbers of the States: and the bill has allotted to eight of   the States more than one for thirty thousand.
