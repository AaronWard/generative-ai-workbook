 GENTLEMAN,  The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good   as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist Association, give   me the highest satisfaction. My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit   of the interests of my constituents, and in proportion as they are persuaded   of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more   pleasing.  Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man   and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship,   that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions,   I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people   which declared that their legislature should &quot;make no law respecting an   establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&quot; thus   building a wall of separation between church and State. Adhering to this expression   of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall   see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to   restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in   opposition to his social duties.  I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessing of the common   Father and Creator of man, and tender you for yourselves and your religious   association, assurances of my high respect and esteem.
