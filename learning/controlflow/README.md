ControlFlow is a Python framework designed for building agentic AI workflows. It allows developers to create workflows that delegate tasks to LLM (Large Language Model) agents, which are autonomous entities capable of making decisions and performing complex tasks. The framework emphasizes a task-centric approach, enabling the creation of discrete, observable tasks that can be assigned to specialized AI agents. These tasks can be combined into flows to orchestrate more complex behaviors.

### Key Features of ControlFlow:

- **Structured Results**: Tasks can return structured data types supported by Pydantic, not just text.
- **Custom Tools**: Developers can provide any Python function as a tool for agents to use.
- **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents can be assigned to a task to enable collaboration.
- **User Interaction**: Agents can interact with users, allowing for dynamic input and feedback.
- **Flows**: Complex workflows can be created by running tasks with a shared context and message history.

### Benefits of Using ControlFlow:

- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate AI capabilities with existing Python codebases.
- **Fine-grained Control**: Maintain oversight and control over AI workflows.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for both simple scripts and complex applications.
- **Transparency**: Provides insights into AI decision-making processes.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Facilitates quick experimentation with AI-powered features.
- **Productivity**: Focus on application logic while ControlFlow manages AI orchestration.
