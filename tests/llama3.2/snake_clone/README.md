# Snake Clone




```
Write snake clone in python using pygame. you MUST briefly plan out your approach first. Provide FULLY working code with no mistakes. 
```



### Result:

- By just doing a one shot attempt, the model was able to produce a working game - all the rules are not correctly implemented, for example, the snake doesn't get bigger as the sprite passes the food. But not bad for a small local model.
