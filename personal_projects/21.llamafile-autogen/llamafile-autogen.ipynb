      "1. **Tail recursion**: Tail recursion is a technique where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. This allows the compiler to optimize the recursive call and avoid creating new stack frames for each recursive call.

However, it's still a useful technique to know for other recursive functions.\n",

In the case of the Fibonacci function, memoization can significantly improve performance by storing the results of previous Fibonacci calculations in a cache. The cache can be implemented using a dictionary or a hash table.\n",

In the case of the Fibonacci function, dynamic programming can significantly improve performance by storing the results of previous Fibonacci calculations in a table. The table can be implemented using an array or a list.\n",

      "4. **Matrix exponentiation**: Matrix exponentiation is a technique where the Fibonacci function is implemented using matrix multiplication. This technique can significantly improve performance by using a constant number of matrix multiplications to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.\n",
