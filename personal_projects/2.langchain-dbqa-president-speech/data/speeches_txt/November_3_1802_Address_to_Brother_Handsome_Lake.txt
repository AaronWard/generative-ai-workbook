TO BROTHER HANDSOME LAKE:                  I have received the message in writing which you sent me through Captain Irvine,   our confidential agent, placed near you for the purpose of communicating and   transacting between us, whatever may be useful for both nations. I am happy   to learn you have been so far favored by the Divine spirit as to be made sensible   of those things which are for your good and that of your people, and of those   which are hurtful to you; and particularly that you and they see the ruinous   effects which the abuse of spirituous liquors have produced upon them. It has   weakened their bodies, enervated their minds, exposed them to hunger, cold,   nakedness, and poverty, kept them in perpetual broils, and reduced their population.   I do not wonder then, brother, at your censures, not only on your own people,   who have voluntarily gone into these fatal habits, but on all the nations of   white people who have supplied their calls for this article. But these nations   have done to you only what they do among themselves. They have sold what individuals   wish to buy, leaving to every one to be the guardian of his own health and happiness.   Spirituous liquors are not in themselves bad, they are often found to be an   excellent medicine for the sick; it is the improper and intemperate use of them,   by those in health, which makes them injurious. But as you find that your people   cannot refrain from an ill use of them, I greatly applaud your resolution not   to use them at all. We have too affectionate a concern for your happiness to   place the paltry gain on the sale of these articles in competition with the   injury they do you. And as it is the desire of your nation, that no spirits   should be sent among them, I am authorized by the great council of the United   States to prohibit them. I will sincerely cooperate with your wise men in any   proper measures for this purpose, which shall be agreeable to them.         You remind me, brother, of what I said to you, when you visited me the last   winter, that the lands you then held would remain yours, and shall never go   from you but when you should be disposed to sell. This I now repeat, and will   ever abide by. We, indeed, are always ready to buy land; but we will never ask   but when you wish to sell; and our laws, in order to protect you against imposition,   have forbidden individuals to purchase lands from you; and have rendered it   necessary, when you desire to sell, even to a State, that an agent from the   United States should attend the sale, see that your consent is freely given,   a satisfactory price paid, and report to us what has been done, for our approbation.   This was done in the late case of which you complain. The deputies of your nation   came forward, in all the forms which we have been used to consider as evidence   of the will of your nation. They proposed to sell to the State of New York certain   parcels of land, of small extent, and detached from the body of your other lands;   the State of New York was desirous to buy. I sent an agent, in whom we could   trust, to see that your consent was free, and the sale fair. All was reported   to be free and fair. The lands were your property. The right to sell is one   of the rights of property. To forbid you the exercise of that right would be   a wrong to your nation. Nor do I think, brother, that the sale of lands is,   under all circumstances, injurious to your people. While they depended on hunting,   the more extensive the forest around them, the more game they would yield. But   going into a state of agriculture, it may be as advantageous to a society, as   it is to an individual, who has more land than he can improve, to sell a part,   and lay out the money in stocks and implements of agriculture, for the better   improvement of the residue. A little land well stocked and improved, will yield   more than a great deal without stock or improvement. I hope, therefore, that   on further reflection, you will see this transaction in a more favorable light,   both as it concerns the interest of your nation, and the exercise of that superintending   care which I am sincerely anxious to employ for their subsistence and happiness.   Go on then, brother, in the great reformation you have undertaken. Persuade   our red brethren then to be sober, and to cultivate their lands; and their women   to spin and weave for their families. You will soon see your women and children   well fed and clothed, your men living happily in peace and plenty, and your   numbers increasing from year to year. It will be a great glory to you to have   been the instrument of so happy a change, and your children's children, from   generation to generation, will repeat your name with love and gratitude forever.   In all your enterprises for the good of your people, you may count with confidence   on the aid and protection of the United States, and on the sincerity and zeal   with which I am myself animated in the furthering of this humane work. You are   our brethren of the same land; we wish your prosperity as brethren should do.   Farewell.
