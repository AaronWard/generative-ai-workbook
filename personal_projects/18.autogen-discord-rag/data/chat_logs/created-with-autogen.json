Then any new request is cosine matched and routes to that cheaper inference points. HF carries even higher weight so any feedback from me or user will add extra points to scoring.

Right now I think it goes down to receive function: \n```        if reply is not None:\n            self.send(reply, sender, silent=silent)\n        else:\n            # kill socket connection object\n``` \nBut I'm afraid this will close the connection when a certain agent completed its task, not the entire conversation is over.

If the chain of agents performs it in eg. 5 minutes at a cost of $100 (on a production heavy duty model), and the same chain of people IRL would do it in 1 hour but at the cost of $600 for their combined time, then the cost is clear.\n\nUsing Autogen to do end-to-end coding tasks is going to be expensive either way because you need a much larger chain of agents that have less restrictions on them (they're not just performing a robotic task).

On the first pass a code writing assistant works with a dev consultant assistant to plan and write the code and unit tests based on the specifications. To avoid issues with it hanging when running the server with uvicorn or wsgi we instruct the assistant to only validate the code is working with by running the unittest suite.\n\n2. Next control is passed to a quality assurance assistant who opens and inspects each file to produce a todo list of any outstanding work in relation to the original spec an also suggests improvements that could be made. \n\n3. The code writing assistant reads the todos, checks the project file structure, opens and reads any files that have associated todos and implements the changes with help from the dev consultant.\n\nThe plan is to be able to prompt the agents to add additional data models, endpoints and tests to build out a full api. \n\nThanks to @andyinater for sharing his work on IterativeCoding, really helped me to get kicked off on this journey.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1153072414184452236/1158564427117903882","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-09T15:35:16.701000+00:00","embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://github.com/OrderAndCh4oS/iterative-coding-fastapi-crud-autogen","title":"GitHub - OrderAndCh4oS/iterative-coding-fastapi-crud-autogen: scrat...","description":"scratch to play with autogen agents.

If you know how Agile projects works you'll see that the 32K limit is not an issue at all.\n\nYou divide the planning into 2 levels: the global level (the big step of the entire project), the currrent project step tasks. Actually GTP4 was even able to partially do that by itself with just a few hints when I tried it locally on my OADS project.\n\nSo your \"big plan\" +  \"current step\" tasks never take too much space. Actually they use around the same size all along the way from the start to the end.\n\nAs for the big code base, [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) has already partially solved the problem (as I also did in my [OpenAI Forge](https://github.com/ivangabriele/openai-forge-vsce) extension. I use both of them for my job where I work with quite large and very complex applications code (~50k source code files).\n\nThey are not perfect but the solution is: file path contextualization.
