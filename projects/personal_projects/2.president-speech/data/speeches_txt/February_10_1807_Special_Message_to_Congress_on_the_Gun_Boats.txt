TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES                  In compliance with the request of the House of Representatives, expressed in   their resolution of the 5th instant, I proceed to give such information as is   possessed, of the effect of gun-boats in the protection and defense of harbors,   of the numbers thought necessary, and of the proposed distribution of them among   the ports and harbors of the United States.         Under the present circumstances, and governed by the intentions of the legislature,   as manifested by their annual appropriations of money for the purposes of defence,   it has been concluded to combine -- 1st, land batteries, furnished with heavy   cannon and mortars, and established on all the points around the place favorable   for preventing vessels from lying before it; 2d, movable artillery which may   be carried, as an occasion may require, to points unprovided with fixed batteries;   3d, floating batteries; and 4th, gun-boats, which may oppose an enemy at its   entrance and co-operate with the batteries for his expulsion. On this subject professional men were consulted as far as we had opportunity.   General Wilkinson, and the late General Gates, gave their opinions in writing,   in favor of the system, as will be seen by their letters now communicated. The   higher officers of the navy gave the same opinions in separate conferences,   as their presence at the seat of government offered occasions of consulting   them, and no difference of judgment appeared on the subjects. Those of Commodore   Barron and Captain Tingey, now here, are recently furnished in writing, and   transmitted herewith to the legislature. The efficacy of gun-boats for the defence of harbors, and of other smooth and   enclosed waters, may be estimated in part from that of galleys, formerly much   used, but less powerful, more costly in their construction and maintenance,   and requiring more men. But the gun-boat itself is believed to be in use with   every modern maritime nation for the purpose of defence. In the Mediterranean,   on which are several small powers, whose system like ours is peace and defence,   few harbors are without this article of protection. Our own experience there   of the effect of gun-boats for harbor service, is recent. Algiers is particularly   known to have owed to a great provision of these vessels the safety of its city,   since the epoch of their construction. Before that it had been repeatedly insulted   and injured. The effect of gun-boats at present in the neighborhood of Gibraltar,   is well known, and how much they were used both in the attack and defence of   that place during a former war. The extensive resort to them by the two greatest   naval powers in the world, on an enterprise of invasion not long since in prospect,   shows their confidence in their efficacy for the purposes for which they are   suited. By the northern powers of Europe, whose seas are particularly adapted   to them, they are still more used. The remarkable action between the Russian   flotilla of gun-boats and galleys, and a Turkish fleet of ships-of-the-line   and frigates, in the Liman sea, 1788, will be readily recollected. The latter,   commanded by their most celebrated admiral, were completely defeated, and several   of their ships-of-the-line destroyed. From the opinions given as to the number of gun-boats necessary for some of   the principal seaports, and from a view of all the towns and ports from Orleans   to Maine inclusive, entitled to protection, in proportion to their situation   and circumstances, it is concluded, that to give them a due measure of protection   in time of war, about two hundred gun-boats will be requisite. According to   first ideas, the following would be their general distribution, liable to be   varied on more mature examination, and as circumstances shall vary, that is   to say: -- To the Mississippi and its neighboring waters, forty gun-boats. To Savannah and Charleston, and the harbors on each side, from St. Mary's to   Currituck, twenty-five. To the Chesapeake and its waters, twenty. To Delaware bay and river, fifteen. To New York, the Sound, and waters as far as Cape Cod, fifty. To Boston and the harbors north of Cape Cod, fifty.   The flotilla assigned to these several stations, might each be under the care   of a particular commandant, and the vessels composing them would, in ordinary,   be distributed among the harbors within the station in proportion to their importance. Of these boats a proper proportion would be of the larger size, such as those   heretofore built, capable of navigating any seas, and of reinforcing occasionally   the strength of even the most distant port when menaced with danger. The residue   would be confined to their own or the neighboring harbors, would be smaller,   less furnished for accommodation, and consequently less costly. Of the number   supposed necessary, seventy-three are built or building, and the hundred and   twenty-seven still to be provided, would cost from five to six hundred thousand   dollars. Having regard to the convenience of the treasury, as well as to the   resources of building, it has been thought that one half of these might be built   in the present year, and the other half the next. With the legislature, however,   it will rest to stop where we are, or at any further point, when they shall   be of opinion that the number provided shall be sufficient for the object. At times when Europe as well as the United States shall be at peace, it would   not be proposed that more than six or eight of these vessels should be kept   afloat. When Europe is in war, treble that number might be necessary to be distributed   among those particular harbors which foreign vessels of war are in the habit   of frequenting, for the purpose of preserving order therein. But they would be manned, in ordinary, with only their complement for navigation,   relying on the seamen and militia of the port if called into action on sudden   emergency. It would be only when the United States should themselves be at war,   that the whole number would be brought into actual service, and would be ready   in the first moments of the war to co-operate with other means for covering   at once the line of our seaports. At all times, those unemployed would be withdrawn   into places not exposed to sudden enterprise, hauled up under sheds from the   sun and weather, and kept in preservation with little expense for repairs or   maintenance. It must be superfluous to observe, that this species of naval armament is proposed   merely for defensive operation; that it can have but little effect toward protecting   our commerce in the open seas even on our coast; and still less can it become   an excitement to engage in offensive maritime war, toward which it would furnish   no means.
