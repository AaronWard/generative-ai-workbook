### TaskWeaver




- **Planner**: Manages task decomposition and execution.
- **Code Generator (CG)**: Generates Python code snippets from user requests, leveraging plugins and examples.
- **Code Executor (CE)**: Executes generated code and maintains execution context.

### Setup

**Ste 1: Install**
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver.git
cd TaskWeaver
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


**Step 2: Make folder structure**

Project folder should look like this:
```bash
ðŸ“¦project
 â”£ ðŸ“œtaskweaver_config.json # the configuration file for TaskWeaver
 â”£ ðŸ“‚plugins # the folder to store plugins
 â”£ ðŸ“‚planner_examples # the folder to store planner examples
 â”£ ðŸ“‚codeinterpreter_examples # the folder to store code interpreter examples
 â”£ ðŸ“‚sample_data # the folder to store sample data used for evaluations
 â”£ ðŸ“‚logs # the folder to store logs, will be generated after program starts
 â”— ðŸ“‚workspace # the directory stores session dataï¼Œ will be generated after program starts
    â”— ðŸ“‚ session_id 
      â”£ ðŸ“‚ces # the folder used by the code execution service
      â”— ðŸ“‚cwd # the current working directory to run the generated code
```

Here is the command to do this quickly:
```bash
mkdir <some_project_name>
cd <some_project_name>
mkdir -p plugins planner_examples codeinterpreter_examples sample_data logs workspace/session_id/ces workspace/session_id/cwd
touch taskweaver_config.json

cd .. # cd outside the project directory
```

**Step 3: Update `taskweaver_config.json``
Add this to the file, by leaving `llm.api_key` blank it will ask you in the terminal.
```json
{
    "llm.api_base": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "llm.api_key": "", // replace with your own
    "llm.model": "gpt-4-1106-preview"
}
```

** Step 3: Run Taskweaver

You can run taskweaver in the CLI
```bash
python -m taskweaver -p ./<project name>
```

Or you can run as a library:
```
cd TaskWeaver
pip install -e . 
```

### Task Weaver vs Autogen:


**Task Weaver:**

- **Code Generation:** TaskWeaverâ€™s primary advantage lies in its code-first design, which is especially beneficial for applications requiring direct manipulation and processing of data. Itâ€™s an effective tool for workloads that require interacting with code and data structures over abstract conversational models.
- Handling of complex data structures like pandas DataFrame.
- There are 3 components: Planner, Code Generator (CG), and Code Executor (CE). Autogen architecture is different, where the agent that corresponds with the human is the one who executes code. 
- TaskWeaver can be expanded into a multi-agent architecture for more complex projects and functionality.
 
**Autogen:**
- Human-AI Collaboration: Autogen allows for human interaction within a conversation
- Non data centric tasks: While TaskWeaver is ideal for data-centric tasks and analytics, AutoGen's capabilities extend to a broader range of dynamic, interactive applications. This makes AutoGen more versatile in handling diverse scenarios, from decision-making tasks to interactive games.
