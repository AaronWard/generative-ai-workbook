## 32. Book Reader

i want to create a web application project. The purpose is this:

- Book are great for instances when you want to describe a concept in words, but may lack the impact if someone can't visualize what you're talking about
- Video content is great for when you want to talk about something that requires you to see what the speaker is talking about. 

I want to create a visualized book, where a user can go through a book, and have it read out to them in realtime. As the story is being read out using text to speech, the UI can visualize it with attachments like attached images, videos and other things the user wants to convey. The user can pause the book, as if it is an interactive video. They can ask further questions about parts in the video, making it a new type of way to learn about something, encapsulating the best of audio books, text books, video and intelligent context. 
- Some additional features could be intelligent curation of the music being played as the voice is reading.
