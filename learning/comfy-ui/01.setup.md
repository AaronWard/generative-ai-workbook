- Squares on the UI are nodes, they're used to load models, input text, generate images etc.
- the line between nodes show how information move between them
- you can click "queue" to start an image generation with the default nodes

- go to civit.ai -> search juggernaut -> seelext the SDXL version of the Juggernaut model -> download
- Models should be moved to this directory:
```bash
/Users/aw/OrbStack/docker/containers/amazing_hamilton/home/user/app/models/checkpoints
```

- When you save a workflow, it is saved to this folder
```bash
/Users/aw/OrbStack/docker/containers/amazing_hamilton/home/user/app/user/aw_06fccb1b-1fea-44f1-bef1-8b97d82c3c2f/workflows
