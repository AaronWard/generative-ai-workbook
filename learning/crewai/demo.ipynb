The latest annual McKinsey Global Survey on the current state of AI confirms the explosive growth of generative AI (gen AI) tools. Less than a year after many of these tools debuted, one-third of our survey respondents say their organizations are using gen AI regularly in at least one business function. The 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle™ for Artificial Intelligence (AI) identifies innovations and techniques that offer significant and even transformational benefits while also addressing the limitations and risks of fallible systems. AI strategies should consider which offer the most credible cases for investment. Here are the top 10 AI and machine learning trends to prepare for in 2024. 1. Multimodal AI Multimodal AI goes beyond traditional single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information. 1.
