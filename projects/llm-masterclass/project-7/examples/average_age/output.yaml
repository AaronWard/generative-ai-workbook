Thought: To answer this question effectively, I need to first understand the problem and plan out a strategy for solving it.
Action: [No action]
Action Input: [No action input]
Observation: [No action] is not a valid tool, try one of [python_repl_ast].
Thought: I need to use the given data dictionary and project phases to come up with a strategy.
Action: [No action]
Action Input: [No action input]
Observation: [No action] is not a valid tool, try one of [python_repl_ast].
Thought: To start, I need to determine what data I need and how I will collect it.
Action: [No action]
Action Input: [No action input]
Observation: [No action] is not a valid tool, try one of [python_repl_ast].
Thought: Using the data dictionary, I can see that I need the PATIENT_ID, STATE FIPS, DIAGNOSED_COVID, DIAGNOSES_DATE, CURRENT_AGE, and AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS data points.
Action: [No action]
Action Input: [No action input]
Observation: [No action] is not a valid tool, try one of [python_repl_ast].
Thought: Next, I will need to use python and pandas to gather the data and prepare it for analysis.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df.info()
Observation: <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 1000 entries, 0 to 999
Data columns (total 8 columns):
 #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------            --------------  -----  
 0   Unnamed: 0        1000 non-null   int64  
 1   PATIENT_ID        1000 non-null   object 
 2   STATE             1000 non-null   object 
 3   FIPS              1000 non-null   int64  
 4   DIAGNOSED_COVID   1000 non-null   int64  
 5   DIAGNOSES_DATE    492 non-null    object 
 6   CURRENT_AGE       1000 non-null   int64  
 7   AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS  492 non-null    float64
dtypes: float64(1), int64(4), object(3)
memory usage: 62.6+ KB

Thought: Now I have confirmed that I have all the data points I need.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df.groupby("DIAGNOSED_COVID")["CURRENT_AGE"].mean()
Observation: DIAGNOSED_COVID
0    49.098425
1    47.975610
Name: CURRENT_AGE, dtype: float64
Thought: I have the mean age of people who have been and haven't been diagnosed. Now I need to plot this to an image and save it to the working directory.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df.groupby("DIAGNOSED_COVID")["CURRENT_AGE"].mean().plot(kind="bar")
Observation: Axes(0.125,0.11;0.775x0.77)
Thought: Now I need to save this image to the working directory.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: plt.savefig("average_age.png")
Observation: NameError: name 'plt' is not defined
Thought: Oh, I need to add a plt before saving the figure.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Observation: 
Thought: Now I'll save the figure.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: plt.savefig("average_age.png")
Observation: 
Thought: I have achieved my goal, the image I saved should contain the average age of people who have been and haven't been diagnosed with COVID-19.
Final Answer: I have achieved my goal, the image I saved to the working directory should contain the average age of people who have been and haven't been diagnosed with COVID-19.

# I kind needed to remind it to plot the image a few times with this, i had to be more explicit by saying
# "plot to an image". Maybe for user experience, you could automate this with a button
# and that would inject an explicit outline for plotting with this given task. 
# Nice to see it quickly recovered from whatever spasm it was having at the start with
# the actions not working.
