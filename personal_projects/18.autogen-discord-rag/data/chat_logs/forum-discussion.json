It will help you up and down your online instances in one click, without any config (or HF key): https://github.com/ivangabriele/docker-llm. If you want more pre-loaded LLM models available in the tags, just ask me. I will try to build and push the most popular ones. I started by focusing on 16k-context models because for the most advanced tasks, 4K-context models are kind of useless. \n- Secondly I also created a one-click deployment for [Functionary LLM](https://github.com/MeetKai/functionary): https://github.com/ivangabriele/docker-functionary. Functionary LLM is one of the rare open-source solutions to Function Calling in Autogen outside of OpenAI world. You will need [this hack](https://github.com/ivangabriele/openai-autogen-dev-studio/blob/main/libs/functionary.py) to make it work, but even with that, it doesn't always work. This hack may certainly be improved.\n- That's why I gave up on using Function Calling from an open-source LLM - for now. It takes a hell lot of time to try to get the few existing solutions to work \"as is\" in Autogen. And it's quite cheap + efficient to assign a Function Calling role to GTP3.5 (via OpenAI API) while handling all the rest with an open-source LLM.\n- I'm still struggling to micro-manage relationships between my agents in OADS but I'm making progress, step by step. Hopefully I'll be able to finally push a first alpha version within 1 or 2 weeks.\n\nA last note: The lowest price I get when deploying my images is from Vast.ai. Even if I hate their UX. And their instances organization is a real jungle. But as long as it only takes a single click to up/down, you may not care. I created ready-to-use templates for both Vast.ai and RunPod.io that you can see in my [README](https://github.com/ivangabriele/docker-llm#readme).","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-30T17:34:00.208000+00:00","embeds":[],"flags":4,"hit":true,"id":"1168601381339410544","mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"pinned":false,"timestamp":"2023-10-30T17:24:40.875000+00:00","tts":false,"type":0,"username":"ivangabriele"},{"attachments":[],"author":{"id":"716588682613620766","username":".jkyh","global_name":"joshkyh","avatar":"5cd40e72aeb64eb517a0753c2d09ba5c","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"channel_id":"1167915900712796231","components":[],"content":"I tried to solve this problem with select_speaker in this PR and succeeded.\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/autogen/pull/482\n\nI hope to learn how to use register_reply in my next attempt.","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-30T06:08:42.806000+00:00","embeds":[],"flags":4,"hit":true,"id":"1168431141242544138","mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"396750654305206273","username":"Aaa","global_name":null,"avatar":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"6960","public_flags":0}],"pinned":false,"timestamp":"2023-10-30T06:08:12.473000+00:00","tts":false,"type":19,"username":".jkyh","message_reference":{"channel_id":"1167915900712796231","guild_id":"1153072414184452236","message_id":"1167915900712796231"}},{"attachments":[],"author":{"id":"251453564512108544","username":"drinkoblog.weebly.com","global_name":"drinko","avatar":"98ff5a0d1358b237361cb063f96b1a86","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"channel_id":"1158548894209282078","components":[],"content":"for those wanting to keep their autogen costs down, i have pplx-api beta working with autogen. i posted instructions on official perplexity server https://discord.com/channels/1047197230748151888/1054944216876331118/1168393509678632990\n\nthe perplexity (pplx) API is currently 'unlimited' (rate limited) for a subscription cost.  presumably soon they will introduce pay per query pricing model.\n\nhavent subscribed to pplx yet?  use my referral and we both get a discount! https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=WH6YCUP6","edited_timestamp":null,"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=WH6YCUP6","title":"Perplexity Pro","description":"Unlock the most powerful AI research assistant.

Although there is no mention of \"Python\" in the `AssistantAgent` class name, it indeed does not have native support to execute other programming language. But there are two possible extension choices to provide that support:  Approach 1: create a new class and override the `execute_code_blocks` function https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L887 such that it could execute prolog code, and then change the system message to instruct the class to write Prolog code. Possible approach 2: do not create a new class but use function call: register a function that execute prolog code, and prompt the `AssistantAgent` to write prolog code.

Divide 6 by the previous result: 6 / 0.25 = 24\n\nSo the solution is (6 / (1 - (3 / 4))) = 24.\n\n\nWHICH IS CORRECT.\n\nBut if I then ask ChatGPT for other solutions, I get wrong answers …\n\nMY QUESTION: How could the Game of 24 be solved by AutoGen ?

The good thing about it is that it enables users to build LLM applications really fast once you get used to it. But, there are some [posts](https://minimaxir.com/2023/07/langchain-problem/) about why it sometimes is an overkill. (From my POV, [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) by MS is a direct competitor to LangChain.)\n\nAutoGPT is a single agent system that instructs itself based on each execution step. It's a nice demonstration of what an agent system can be capable of, but it has clear limitations. I've written about this in a [blog](https://blog.justasq.it/dissecting-autogpt/). (I think [PromptFlow](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow) by MS is a direct competitor to AutoGPT.)\n\nLlamaIndex is mainly focused on creating agent systems that operate upon RAG. If you look at [Jerry's Twitter](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0), the co-founder and CEO of LlamaIndex, he posts a lot about RAG, in general.\n\nAutoGen is the best one so far, I think. It's not the first multi-agent framework but it seems like the most concrete. If you've looked into other ones like [MetaGPT's codebase](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT), you'll be shocked. (No offense.)\n\nOverall, I think they're all great advancements for agent systems. It seems similar to the web era, where various web-frameworks, even now, have been bursting into the world.","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-25T02:36:39.778000+00:00","embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://minimaxir.com/2023/07/langchain-problem/","title":"The Problem With LangChain","description":"LangChain is complicated, so it must be better.

My issue on XAgent github regarding a potential XAgent-Autogen integration has been mentioned here, however, it is written that there is an ongoing process to integrate it (by the XAgent team). To the best of my knowledge, XAgent core devs and contributors haven't openly discussed this possibility yet. \n\nI have also mentioned this potential integration on this discord channel (and also on XAgent discord channel), which was first mentioned here by @beer23. \n\nWhat's more, there is now another github issue on XAgent regarding XAgent-Autogen integration: \nhttps://github.com/OpenBMB/XAgent/issues/62\n\nIt appears that many are quite into this potential integration. XAgent may be a useful integration just like the MemGPT integration. As XAgent itself acts like a special general-purpose multi-agent system; XAgent on Autogen framework could be multi-XAgents where some agents are or each agent is like a multi-agent, or an implementation of XAgent as a special agent type within the Autogen framework, or other combinations. \n\nWould be glad to hear your comments and thoughts on this.","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-23T04:15:39.947000+00:00","embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoGenAI/s/Sujiiee1x6","title":"From the AutoGenAI community on Reddit: What is the case in favor o...","description":"Explore this post and more from the AutoGenAI community","provider":{"name":"Reddit"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://share.redd.it/preview/post/17cw4sf","proxy_url":"https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/dO9HDyUFAwCLedpZ7ELzFBbNUCCV3ZPg2zFps0cKxoE/https/share.redd.it/preview/post/17cw4sf","width":1120,"height":584},"content_scan_version":1},{"type":"article","url":"https://github.com/OpenBMB/XAgent/issues/62","title":"What is different between  XAgent and AutoGen?  · Issue #62 · OpenB...","description":"What is different between XAgent and AutoGen?

The code defines a `GroupChat` data class that represents a group chat:\n   - It contains data fields such as `agents` (a list of participating agents), `messages` (a list of messages in the chat), `max_round` (the maximum number of rounds), `admin_name` (the name of the admin agent, default is \"Admin\"), and `func_call_filter` (a flag to enforce function call filtering).\n   - The class provides various methods to interact with the group chat, such as resetting the chat, finding the next speaker based on a message, selecting the next agent, generating a message for selecting the next speaker, and more.\n\n3. The code defines a `GroupChatManager` class that extends the `ConversableAgent` class:\n   - It represents a chat manager agent that can manage a group chat of multiple agents.\n   - The class initializes with parameters such as the `groupchat` (an instance of `GroupChat`), `name` (name of the chat manager), `max_consecutive_auto_reply` (limit of consecutive auto replies), `human_input_mode` (mode for human inputs), `system_message` (initial system message), and additional keyword arguments.\n   - The class overrides the `run_chat` method to run the group chat by iterating over rounds, selecting the next speaker, and generating replies from agents.\n\nOverall, this code provides a framework for creating and managing group chat conversations among multiple agents. It allows agents to take turns speaking, select the next speaker, and simulate a role-playing game-like interaction.","edited_timestamp":null,"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/autogen/agentchat/groupchat.py","title":"autogen/autogen/agentchat/groupchat.py at main · microsoft/autogen","description":"Enable Next-Gen Large Language Model Applications.

These queries require the LLM to produce code that invokes external APIs to answer the user’s question, yet LLMs rarely produce correct code on the first try, requiring iterative code refinement upon execution results. In addition, using LLM assistants to support high query volumes can be expensive. In this work, we contribute a framework, EcoAssistant1, that enables LLMs to answer code-driven queries more affordably and accurately. EcoAssistant contains three components. First, it allows the LLM assistants to converse with an automatic code executor to iteratively refine code or to produce answers based on the execution results. Second, we use a hierarchy of LLM assistants, which attempts to answer the query with weaker, cheaper LLMs before backing off to stronger, expensive ones. Third, we retrieve solutions from past successful queries as in-context demonstrations to help subsequent queries.

Chainlit allows for asynchronousicity which allows you to run chainlit and autogen agents at the same time, therefore it is much cleaner to integrate with autogen. https://github.com/AaronWard/generative-ai-workbook/tree/main/personal_projects/9.chainlit-autogen","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-14T15:16:19.486000+00:00","embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://github.com/AaronWard/generative-ai-workbook/tree/main/personal_projects/9.chainlit-autogen","title":"generative-ai-workbook/personal_projects/9.chainlit-autogen at main...","description":"Central repository for all LLM development.
